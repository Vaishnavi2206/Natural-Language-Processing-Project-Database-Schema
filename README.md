1] Tables:

company_info: Consists information about companies.
event_info: Consists information about events.
people_info: Consists information about people working in companies.

2] Relationships:

Relationship 1: Events and company data can be merged using ‘event_url’ column.
Relationship 2: Company and people data can be merged using ‘homepage_base_url’ colum.

3] Attributes:

This repository contains the CREATE TABLE definitions for all three tables (company_info, event_info, people_info) in the database schema, along with corresponding CSV files for data insertion.

4] Challenges Faced:

During the development and management of this database, several challenges were encountered:

Ensuring Data Integrity: Maintaining data consistency and integrity across multiple tables and transactions was a significant challenge

Handling Large Datasets: Efficiently managing and querying large volumes of data posed challenges in terms of performance optimization, indexing strategies, and resource allocation.

Managing Queries for Different Data Types: Adapting queries and schema changes when transitioning data types, such as converting from VARCHAR to TIMESTAMP for date columns

5] Improvements for Database Design
Given more time to work on the database design, several improvements could be implemented:

Normalization Refinement: Further normalize the schema to eliminate redundancy and improve data consistency.

Indexing Strategy: Implement a comprehensive indexing strategy based on query patterns and performance benchmarks to enhance query speed.

Schema Flexibility: Design the schema to be more flexible to accommodate future changes and new requirements more seamlessly.

Documentation: Enhance schema documentation to improve understanding and ease of maintenance for future developers.
